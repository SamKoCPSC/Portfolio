            <p class = "subheader">Hello, my name is Samuel Ko, and I am currently a third-year student at the University of British Columbia,
                studying for a Bachelors in Computer Science. I started programming in High School when I took a 
                course called AP Computer Science, and it has become my passion ever since. In particular, my professional 
                interests are Web Development, App Development, and Machine Learning, but I am fascinated by all the 
                different aspects and fields of Computer Science. I am a self-driven and motivated person who loves to 
                work and talk with other people.<br><br>
                If you would like to contact me, I'd love to hear from you via my e-mail or phone. <br>

                the shortest path in a grid based graph. Features a user interactable grid to allow modification of the grid layout such as 
                adding walls or weights. Allows for multiple start and end points.
