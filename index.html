            <p class = "subheader">Hello, my name is Samuel Ko, and I am currently a third-year student at the University of British Columbia,
                studying for a Bachelors in Computer Science. I started programming in High School when I took a 
                course called AP Computer Science, and it has become my passion ever since. In particular, my professional 
                interests are Web Development, App Development, and Machine Learning, but I am fascinated by all the 
                different aspects and fields of Computer Science. I am a self-driven and motivated person who loves to 
                work and talk with other people.<br><br>
                If you would like to contact me, I'd love to hear from you via my e-mail or phone. <br>

            <p class = "title">Pathfinding Visualizer</p>
            <p class = "description">A project that I developed with basic <em><b>JavaScript, HTML and CSS</b></em>. 
                Visualizes the process of <em><b>Dikjstra's Algorithm</b></em> for finding 
                the shortest path in a grid based graph. Features a user interactable grid to allow modification of the grid layout such as 
                adding walls or weights. Allows for multiple start and end points.

            <p class = "description">A mini-app coded in <em><b>Java</b></em>, designed using the <em><b>JavaFX</b></em> library, and tested with <em><b>JUnit</b></em>. Analyzes the contents 
                of user input and outputs results such as character count, or reversed string. Features a save and load system using text files 
                that can load the results from previous iterations.

                <div class="skillBox">
                    <h2>Java</h2>
                    <p>Experience: 20 months <br>My most used language, as it was the core language in my intro courses, as well as for both my
                    courses in Object-Oriented Programming. I have learned, and am familiar with the core principles such as abstraction, encapsulation
                    inheritance, and polymorphism. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="skillBox">
                    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>Experience: 5 months <br>The language I learn most in my own time. I learn it alongside HTML and CSS. I have used it to script the functional
                        parts of most of my own projects, and it is the main language that I am continually practicing currently.
                        I am familiar with the specifics such as high-order array functions, arrow functions, promises, and destructuring.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="skillBox">
                    <h2>C/C++</h2>
                    <p>Experience: 12 months <br>Mainly used as the core language of both my Data Structures and Algorithms courses, and a course on 
                    Computer Systems, which explored lower level programming. I have learned about pointers, and memory management, as well as all
                    things linked lists, trees, and graphs, and also hashing, sorting, and searching.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="skillBox">
                    <h2>JUnit</h2>
                    <p>Experience: 8 months <br>The testing framework used in my courses on Object-Oriented Programming for learning about unit testing
                    principles. Concepts like, test isolation, thourough coverage and edge case consideration were practiced extensively. Most of my course work
                    in Java involved unit testing.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="skillBox">
                    <h2>React</h2>
                    <p>Experience: 2 months <br>I have used this framework for creating my Sorting Visualizer project. It is the framework that I am currently practicing most.
                    I find its fundamental ideas like components, state, and JSX syntax to be very convienient for web page design.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="skillBox">
                    <h2>JavaFX and Java Swing</h2>
                    <p>Experience: 4 months <br>I have experience in both for about 2 months each. Java Swing was used primarily on graphical projects in 
                    my course work, while I used JavaFX for designing my Text Analyzer project. I found the optional integration of CSS style syntax for styling components 
                    in JavaFX to be a convienient alternative to manually setting attributes.
