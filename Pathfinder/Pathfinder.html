                    This is a project developed by Samuel Ko as a learning project for basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project is designed to highlight basic webpage design concepts, </br>
                    simple animation, user interaction, and an understanding of pathfinding algorithms both algorithmically and visually. The project's major components were </br>
                    developed over the course of a week in which the challenge was to add as much functionality as possible. The goal was to make a visualizer that could be a </br>
                    potentially useful learning tool or something fun to play around with.

                    Clicking one of the "add" buttons will allow you to click and drag across the grid to modify the nodes of the grid. </br></br>
                    A start node is a point or points where the algorithm will start its search </br></br>
                    An end node is a point or points where the algorithm will end its search </br></br>
                    The algorithm will search for the shortest path from a start to an end node, multiple start and end nodes can be created </br></br>
                    A wall node is an impassable obstacle that the algorithm will have to move around </br></br>
                    A weight node adds to the cost of moving over it, normal nodes have a cost of 1 </br></br>
                    When the algorithm is finished a shortest, lowest cost path will be highlighted </br></br>
                    If no path is possible, a path will not be highlighted </br></br>
